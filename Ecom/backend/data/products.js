      "Frankincense has been said to help lift mood and balance hormones, especially in women.  One study which used frankincense alongside other oils known to promote relaxation found that the combination was effective in alleviating depression for terminally ill patients, and may have helped with pain management as well.  Another study conducted on mice found that frankincense stimulates the portion of the brain that regulates emotions, in addition to activating a protein that plays a role in the perception of warmth. These effects together can create a sense of comfort and peace.",
